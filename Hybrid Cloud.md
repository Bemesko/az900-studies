- Simply a mixture of compute resources being deploy to [Public Cloud](Public%20Cloud.md) and [Private Cloud](Private%20Cloud.md)
- In practice there will probably be resources running on a popular public cloud that will communicate with resources running in the private cloud
- Most flexible model
- Organizations are given the most choice of what to control

**Use Cases**:
- There are some sensitive computational resources that the company needs to host on its own, but it doesn't need to do this for everything
- There can be a main cloud with the most commonly used resources and a secondary cloud with surge deployments for peak traffic
