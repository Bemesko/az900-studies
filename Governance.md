- Governance in [Cloud Computing](Cloud%20Computing.md) benefits because almost everything is software-defined, so there can be policies that can be applied and continuously evaluated based on the current infrastructure
- The cloud also has better separation of privileges since specific accounts can be assigned roles to certain resources
- This is closely related to [Security](Security.md)
- [Azure](Azure.md) has templates that can continually audit all resources to make sure compliance standards are met
