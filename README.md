This repository is an Obsidian vault with my notes preparing for the [Az 900](Az%20900.md) exam.

I ended up passing the exam and getting the Azure Fundamentals certification, though I didn't finish documenting everything there was to study about the test. In a way that's ok because the real goal was to do good in the exam, not documenting everything there is to know about [Azure](Azure.md). Still, this might be an interesting resource if you're looking into taking the exam yourself.

The target audience for these notes is me, so there might be some portuguese along with the english notes;

### My current study strategy:
1. Do an initial priming for the concepts I will be studying (jotting down what I know about each concept)
1. Read the Microsoft Learn docs
1. Watch videos such as [John Savill Az 900 Playlist](John%20Savill%20Az%20900%20Playlist.md) in the background of my life
1. Create separate, atomic notes for each concept that stands out and is not obvious
1. Use active recall to review my notes consistently
