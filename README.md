This repository is an Obsidian vault with my notes preparing for the [Az 900](Az%20900.md) exam.

The target audience for these notes is me, so there might be some portuguese along with the english notes;

My current study strategy:
1. Do an initial priming for the concepts I will be studying
1. Read the Microsoft Learn docs
1. Watch videos such as [John Savill Az 900 Playlist](John%20Savill%20Az%20900%20Playlist.md) in the background
1. Create separate, atomic notes for each concept that stands out and is not obvious
1. Use active recall to review my notes consistently
