- **Serverless still counts as [PaaS](Platform%20as%20a%20Service.md)**, because you're still paying for the hability to host and manage something that you have to build yourself to start delivering value
- Usually in the cloud, if you have an application you pay for a provisioned server in which to run it (managed by you or not)
- Serverless computing takes the [Cloud Pricing](Cloud%20Pricing.md) model to the next level, because the user only pays for the amount of computing power their code uses, instead of the underlying infrastructure
- For heavy workloads it's usually better to use a server because serverless tends to be more expensive
- [Azure](Azure.md) offers serverless using [[Azure Functions]] or [[Logic Apps]]

## Benefits
- No infrastructure management
- Scalability
- Only pay for what you use (event driven)
