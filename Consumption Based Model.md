- IT Infrastructure has two types of expenses: [CapEx](CapEx) and [OpEx](OpEx)
- [Cloud Computing](Cloud%20Computing.md) falls under [OpEx](OpEx.md)
- When you buy a resource on the cloud, you usually don't pay all of it upfront, the bulk is payed after a certain period of time based on how much you've used it
- This is beneficial because we can use new resources and innovate without paying huge amounts upfront
- This is also good because we can simply stop paying for stuff we don't use anymore
- No need to estimate future needs
