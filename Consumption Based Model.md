- Concept of [[OpEx]] -> you only pay for what you use
- When you buy a resource on the cloud, you usually don't pay all of it upfront, the bulk is payed after a certain period of time based on how much you've used it
- This is beneficial because we can use new resources and innovate without paying huge amounts upfront
