- The [Cloud](Cloud%20Computing.md) offers an ease of scaling resources based on what is actually needed to provide business value
- This allows for a greater sense of agility because experiments can be tested using very few resources and improved upon by simply scaling the resource usage
- Huge scale can be achieved incrementally rather than all upfront
- When resources are being underused, you can scale them down and decrease how much you're paying

- Scalability has 2 variants:
	- [[Vertical Scaling]]
	 - [[Horizontal Scaling]]
