> Cloud (IT services delivered over the internet) that's used by a single entity

- Natural evolution of a datacenter
- Environment in a data center that is for access specifically to a single enterprise
- Usually the enterprise is big enough to host the cloud by itself, the cloud part comes from it offering its services to all teams around the globe
- Greater control over the hosting environment
- Hosting can be delegated to a third party company
- Some of the [Benefits of Cloud Computing](Benefits%20of%20Cloud%20Computing.md) are a bit lost because the [Shared Responsibility](Shared%20Responsibility.md) isn't really shared
- Data is not collocated with other organizations' data
- Examples: Cloud Foundry stuff, HSDP

**Use Cases**:
- Big company distributing its infrastructure around the globe
- Data privacy and regulatory reasons
