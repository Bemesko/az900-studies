- Logical groupings for [Azure resources](Azure%20resources)
- Cannot be nested
- Ideally they provide a separation in terms of lifecycles -> things that are provisioned together, are deleted together
- When you apply an action to a resource group, you apply it to all its resources
- All resource groups need to live in [Subscriptions](Subscriptions.md)
